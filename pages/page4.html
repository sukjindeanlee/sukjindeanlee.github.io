    <h1>Prison Break</h1>
    <p>This show was one of the first shows I truly was invested in after covid-19.
        From its diverse characters to the intricate plots that have the audience 
        wanting more, it's truly an amazing show about two brothers who seem to have no
        way out of an impossible situation to make it in an intense and wild prison. Overall,
        the actions and plot really made this show amazing.

    <h1>Suits</h1>
    <p>Suits is one of those shows that have you thinking about how your professional worklife
        can ultimately affect your personal life. There are so many different cases that the
        two main characters tackle that create suspense and excitement at the same time. I throughly
        enjoyed watching Mike Ross and Harvey Specter work together.

    <h1>Breaking Bad</h1>
    <p>Breaking Bad is a show I'm currently watching. It's plot is definitely engaging as a
        high school chemistry teacher starts to find different ways of obtaining money after
        seeing everything and everyone fall apart. I loved the cast for the show and even
        Jesse Pinkman who works with Walter White to make it big. I recommend that people watch 
        the show if they are big on action.
